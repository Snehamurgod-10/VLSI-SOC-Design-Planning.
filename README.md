### Basic Bash Commands:  
`cd`   : Change directory.  
`ls`   : List all files.  
`mkdir`: Make a directory.  
`pwd`  : Show the current directory.  
`clear`: Clear the terminal.  
`tree` :This command is used to print the hierarchy of the file system from the present directory.  </a>
# Intro to OpenLane:<a name ="12">  
### OpenLane is an automated RTLtoGDSII flow.  
Here we are working in Sky130_fd_sc_hd PDK varient. where, "sky130" is process name or node name."fd" is a foundary name (skyWater foundary)."sc" means standerd cell librery files and the last one "hd" stands for high density(basically one type of varient).

Sky130_fd_sc_hd varient contains many technology files like verilog, spice, techlef, meglef,mag,gds,cdl,lib,lef,etc. (techlef file contains the layer information).
